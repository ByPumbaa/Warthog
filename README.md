# 🐗 Warthog Reference Implementation

Welcome to Warthog!

Warthog is an experimental L1-cryptocurrency implementation without
specific focus. This project is not a dumb fork of something else. It was developed completely from scratch! 



## 💵 Tokenomics
We are a cryptocurrency for the community where everyone can revive again the good old days when crypto was fun. Therefore we have decided to be free of 💩bullshit:
- 👍 No Premine
- 🤟 No Team/Dev fund
- 😊 100% of supply is publicly mineable
<p align="center">

</p>

The block chain has the following characteristics:
- 1️⃣  Coin unit: 1 WART
- ⏲  Block time: 20s
- 💰 Initial block reward: 3 WART
- 🧮 Precision: 0.00000001 WART (8 digits)
- 🔪 Halving: ~ every 2 years
- 🔒 Supply hard cap : 18921599.68464 (~19m) WART


## 💣 A word of caution
This is new software. Almost everything was 
implemented from scratch. There may be bugs.
Use at your own risk.

## 📦 Component overview

### This Repo
* Reference node implementation of the Warthog Network
* Command line wallet software

### Miner
* GPU/CPU Miner for JanusHash [here](https://github.com/CoinFuMasterShifu/janusminer)

### Additional Tools:
* GUI wallet [here](https://github.com/warthog-network/wart-wallet)
 
## 💻 Installation
Prebuilt binaries of the node daemon and cli wallet for Linux and Windows can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/warthog-network/Warthog/releases). They are staticlly linked and will just work without external dependencies.

Prebuilt binaries of the miner for Linux and HiveOS can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/CoinFuMasterShifu/janusminer/releases)

To compile from source see below or [here](https://warthog.network/docs/) for a more detailed guide.

## 😵‍💫 BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

### Linux Native Build

#### System Requirements

* Linux
* gcc11 or newer
* meson
* ninja

#### Required Steps
* Install gcc, meson, ninja: apt install meson ninja-build build-essential
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ByPumbaa/Warthog`
* cd into the repo: `cd Warthog`
* Create build directory: `meson build .` (`meson build . --buildtype=release` for better performance)
* cd into build directory: `cd build`
* Compile using ninja: `ninja`

### Docker build (node and wallet)
#### System Requirements
* Linux
* Docker

#### Build for Linux
* Run `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -f dockerfiles/build_linux --output build` in the repo directory.
#### Build for Windows (cross-compilation on Linux)
* Run `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -f dockerfiles/build_windows --output ./build/windows` in the repo.
* Windows binaries are located in `./build/windows` directory.
#### Build for MacOS - aarch64 (cross-compilation on Linux)
* Run `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -f dockerfiles/build_macos --output ./build/macos` in the repo.
* MacOS binaries are located in `./build/macos` directory.

## ▶️ USAGE
* Run the node (use some restarter in case it crashes) <br />
One line example to run the node: `screen -dmS wart_node bash -c "while true; do wart-node-linux ; done"` <br />
Use `screen -r wart_node` to see its output and CTRL+A+D to detach from the screen session. <br />
Note: You should run node with  `--rpc=0.0.0.0:3000` to accept remote connections from your other rigs. <br />
* Run the miner (miner requires node running). 
More detailed information how to set up and run the miner you can find [here](https://github.com/CoinFuMasterShifu/janusminer/blob/master/README.md).
* Optional: Run the wallet to send funds (wallet requires node running)
* Good luck and have fun! Use --help the option.

NOTE:  This is a highly experimental project not backed by any institution or foundation. 
 It relies on the work of voluntaries who have no obligation to do work for the project.
 People can join and leave any time at their will.
